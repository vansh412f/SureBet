üìñ The Story Behind SureBet
While exploring the world of sports betting, I discovered arbitrage betting‚Äîa 100% legal, mathematical approach to guarantee a profit by exploiting odds discrepancies across different bookmakers. I was fascinated by the concept but found that every existing tool or service charged a significant fee to access this information.

This project was born out of a challenge: could I build a professional-grade tool to provide this service for free? I wanted to see if I could engineer a complete, end-to-end system that could handle the complexities of real-time data ingestion, resiliently manage a large pool of resources, and present the findings in a polished, user-friendly interface. SureBet is the result of that challenge.

üöÄ Key Features
Real-time Opportunity Updates: A live WebSocket connection pushes new opportunities to the UI instantly.

Live & Historical Views: Toggle between currently active opportunities and a historical archive of past bets.

Advanced Filtering & Sorting: A collapsible sidebar with multi-level filtering by sport, league, bookmaker, and profit percentage.

Dynamic UI: The interface dynamically generates filter options based on the available data for a clean and relevant user experience.

Resilient Backend Engine:

API Key Rotator: Automatically manages a pool of hundreds of API keys, rotating to a new key when a usage limit is reached.

Credit Safety Brake: A self-regulating mechanism that stops data fetching before an API key's credit limit is exceeded, guaranteeing no single run ever fails.

24/7 Scheduled Jobs: Uses node-cron to run the data-scanning process automatically in the background.

Fully Responsive Design: A professional and intuitive layout that works flawlessly on desktop, tablet, and mobile devices.
